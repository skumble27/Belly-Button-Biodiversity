## Purpose of the Study

Studies undertaken by Hulcr et al., (2012) sought to assess the microbial diversity within the belly button and determine if various factors contributed to the variation that may be present in different individuals. Taking this into consideration, the authors assessed a number of volunteers and factored in various parameters, namely, the individuals age, ethnicity, personal hygiene, and belly button structure (inward or outward protrusion) to determine if there was indeed an influence on the types of microbes that would reside within this region. The results of the study indicated that a so called “oligarchy” of microorganisms did indeed reside amongst the sixty volunteers that were assessed, however, the researches have reported the limitations of predicting what rare microbes may exist based on an individuals characteristics as described above. In order to facilitate further research, the data obtained from the study has been consolidated and uploaded onto a website in the form of a dashboard. Users select a particular participant ID to gain further insights into the microorganisms that were identified.
